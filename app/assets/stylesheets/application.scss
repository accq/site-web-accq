 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new

 // Example using 'Cerulean' bootswatch

//Import bootstrap-sprockets
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "font-awesome";


//override theme variables
$black: #333;
$red: #69140F;
$red2: #B31E18;
$brand-danger: #A52C24;
//...

// Import cerulean variables
@import "bootswatch/cerulean/variables";

// Then bootstrap itself
@import "bootstrap";

// Bootstrap body padding for fixed navbar
body { padding-top: 50px; }

// And finally bootswatch style itself
@import "bootswatch/cerulean/bootswatch";

// Whatever application styles you have go last
@import "style";
